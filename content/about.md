# About NZISF
New Zealand Information Security Forum started on 22 February 1996 as an unincorporated society. Founding members were:

- Shayne Bates
- Stephen Cohen
- Garth Dutton
- Lech Janczewski
- Craig Meldrum
- Paul Philips
- Philip Webster

 
To simplify the financial side of operations decision has been made to join an existing association operating in the field.  Several associations were approached offering their support. The decision was made on 27 October 2000 to join NZ Security Association (NZSA). NZSA values highly our activities and we are present at their website:
[https://security.org.nz](https://security.org.nz)

Creation of organization with profile almost identical to our resulted that in July 2023 we become associated with AppSec New Zealand Incorporated.
